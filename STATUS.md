# Contact Form Implementation Status

The task to create separate English and Norwegian contact forms has been completed:

1. Created English contact form (ContactFormEn.tsx) with English labels:
   - "Name" instead of "Navn"
   - "Email" instead of "E-post"
   - "Subject" instead of "Emne"
   - "Message" instead of "Melding"
   - "Sending..." instead of "Sender..."
   - "Send message" instead of "Send melding"
   - Success message: "Message sent! I will respond as soon as possible."
   - Error message: "Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again later."

2. Norwegian contact form (ContactFormNo.tsx) with Norwegian labels is in place.

3. Updated the form page components to use the correct language versions:
   - /app/en/contact/form/page.tsx - Using ContactFormEn
   - /app/no/contact/form/page.tsx - Using ContactFormNo

4. Both forms maintain the same functionality:
   - Same EmailJS integration
   - Same styling and layout
   - Same form validation
   - Same error handling
   - Same success/error state management

The two forms now function independently with their respective language settings.
